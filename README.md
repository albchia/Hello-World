# Hello-World
This is my **first repository created**. The tech sector is really an _adventuring world_!

## What about me?
I am Passionate about _learning, training and education_, teaching to others what I learn.

I have also a big interest in _international cooperation, environment, development, sustainability_ in a Global and Local perspective. My background starts here.

I also discovered a passion about the **tech world**, first relating to Office, then I approach the _big world of coding and programming_... what a discover!

Now I am struggling in learning more and more about the different programming languages, following courses, masters, watching videos and...preparing scripts to tell my story ;) 

What a challenge!
