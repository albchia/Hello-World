# Hello-World
This is my first repository created. What a challenge is the tech world!

I am Passionate about learning, training and education, teaching to others what I learn. 
I have also a big interest in international cooperation, environment, development, sustainability in a Global and Local perspective. My background starts here.
I also discovered a passion about the tech world, first relating to Office Package, then I approach the big world of coding and programming... what a discover!
Now I am struggling in learning more and more about the different programming languages, following courses, masters, watching videos and...preparing scripts to tell my story ;) 
What a challenge!
